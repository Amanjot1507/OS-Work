PortOS Educational Operating System
===================================

This is the PortOS user-level threading library project.  Instructions for
completing the project can be found on the CS4411 course website - http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs4410/2015fa/4411.php

Compiling
=========

To compile an application with the library, you can type "make application".
This will compile the file "application.c" as well as the PortOS library, and
produce an executable "application".

You can edit the "Makefile" file to change what programs are compiled by default
and also what programs are compiled when you type "make all".

Source Code Overview
====================

This release contains three groups of files:

1. low level system primitives
    - defs.h
    - start.c and end.c
    - interrupts.*
    - machine_primitives.*
    - network.*
    - random.*

2. the threading library itself - to be implemented
    - alarm.*
    - minithread.*
    - multilevel_queue.*
    - miniheader.* 
    - minimsg.*
    - minisocket.*
    - queue.*
    - synch.*

3. sample applications
    - buffer.c
    - sieve.c
    - test*.c
    - network[1-6].c 
    - conn-network[1-3].c         

You should not need to edit the system primitives, though you may want to read the header files!
